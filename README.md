# Diabetes-Predict_Public
##INTRODUCTION

###OVERVIEW
This report discusses the result of the work done in the development of “Diabetes Predict” using Machine Learning. It helps people to get their health status regarding diabetes.

##FEASIBILITY STUDY

###OBJECTIVE
The main objective of this project is to create a machine learning model using python which can detect whether a person is diabetic or not and to provide a website from which the users can interact with the model and can also take benefits from the features build in the website.

###METHODOLOGY
First, we need to create the machine learning model for prediction and then create the interface to interact with model then integrate the model with interface. To implement the above goals, the following methodology needs to be followed: 
•	Model Development and Training
•	Creating web templates
•	Integration with Flask
•	Creating Database and user authentication system 
•	Validation
•	Deployment

###SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE MODEL

###RAPID APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT 
Reason: since software size was not much large and
there was a time bound and the project was made in modules therefore in this project I used Rapid Application Development.
A software project can be implemented using this model if the project can be broken down into small modules wherein each module can be assigned independently to separate teams. These modules can finally be combined to form the final product.

##TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES

###HTML
The Hypertext Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.

###CSS
Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

###JAVASCRIPT
JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled and multi-paradigm. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class function.

###BOOTSTRAP
Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.

###PYTHON
Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.

###FLASK
Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools.

###SQLALCHEMY
SQLAlchemy is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.
It provides a full suite of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for efficient and high-performing database access, adapted into a simple and Pythonic domain language.

###MACHINE LEARNING
Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

###JUPYTER NOTEBOOK
Jupyter Notebook is a web-based interactive computational environment for creating notebook documents. A Jupyter Notebook document is a browser-based REPL containing an ordered list of input/output cells which can contain code, text, mathematics, plots and rich media. Underneath the interface, a notebook is a JSON document, following a versioned schema, usually ending with the ".ipynb" extension.

###VS CODE
Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add additional functionality.

###HEROKU
Heroku is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) supporting several programming languages. Heroku is said to be a polyglot platform as it has features for a developer to build, run and scale applications in a similar manner across most languages.

###ANACONDA
Anaconda is a distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing that aims to simplify package management and deployment. The distribution includes data-science packages suitable for Windows, Linux, and macOS. We used anaconda to get access to Anaconda Navigator and Anaconda Prompt.

##LIBRARIES USED
 
###NUMPY
NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. NumPy is open-source software and has many contributors.

###PANDAS
Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. It is free software released under the three-clause BSD license. The name is derived from the term "panel data", an econometrics term for data sets that include observations over multiple time periods for the same individuals.

###SEABORN
Seaborn is a data visualization library built on top of matplotlib and closely integrated with Pandas data structures in Python. Visualization is the central part of Seaborn which helps in exploration and understanding of data.

###MATPLOTLIB
Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK. 

###SCIKIT-LEARN 
Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.

###PICKLE
Pickle module is used for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure. Any object in Python can be pickled so that it can be saved on disk. What pickle does is that it “serializes” the object first before writing it to file. Pickling is a way to convert a python object into a character stream. The idea is that this character stream contains all the information necessary to reconstruct the object in another python script.

###DATASET USED: 

For training and testing machine learning model given Kaggle dataset is used:

  PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset
 https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database

ABOUT DATASET
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database.
